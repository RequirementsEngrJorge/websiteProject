# 1.Introduction
## 1.1 Business purpose

is about, what services they provide, and which areas that they are available to work in.

# 3.Business management requirements
## 3.1 Business environment
The business currently does not have any digital systems in place meaning that this project will be the first one.
## 3.2 Mission, goals, and objectives
The goal of the proposed system is to increase the amount of customers that the business recieves as well as to create a set of expectations in terms
of quality and range of jobs that are perfomed by the business.
## 3.3 Business model
The mission will be achieved by providing concise information about the services that are provided and the limitations of the service, such as a maximum building size 
, and locations that are within reasonable range of business operation.
## 3.4 Information environment
Since no other projects are going on, this project automatically has the highest priority.
# 4.Business operational requirements
## 4.1 Business processes
The webiste would be advertised on the side of the work vehicle, which would be seen while the vehicle is in use and travelling to and from jobs.
## 4.2 Business operational policies and rules
## 4.3 Business operational constraints
On the off chance that the website recieves a high amount of traffic the site will be unlikely to handle it.
## 4.4 Business operational modes
In an unsteady state the website would have to temporarily shut down until the traffic either slows down, or until the issue is resolved.
## 4.5 Business operational quality
Rather than being a website with high levels of detail, animations and emphasis on visuals, the process will instead focus on being functional with important
information about the business being accessible through the front page.
## 4.6 Business structure
# 5. Preliminary operational concept of proposed system
## 5.1 Preliminary operational concept
### a) operational policies and constraints
Current constraints of the system include that it must function on both PC and mobile platforms, it must be accessible and simple to maneuver.
### b) description of the proposed system
The system is a website that will function for both PC and mobile platforms that is intended to provide information about the business so that customers can efficiently find what services they provide as well as to answer any questions they may have regarding availability.
### c) modes of system operation
### d) user classes and other involved personnel
The user classes would incude customers, employees, and owners.
### e) support environment
The system shall be updated when new information about the company is requested to be added, for example things such as availability.
## 5.2 Preliminary operational scenarios
1. Area Availablility - If a customer wants to hire the company to paint their home's interior but is unsure whether their home is too far for the business to operate, the would be able to go on the website and check which counties that the business is willing to work at. 
2. Service Types - A small business owner wants to know if they can hire the company to paint their storefront but are unsure if they offer that kind of ervice, they would be able to check the website to answer their question, and if they are still unsure they can use the contact information listed on the site to ask directly.
# 6. Other preliminary life-cycle concepts
## 6.1 Preliminary acquisition concept
The solution will be aquired by interviewing the owner and getting some of the more frequently asked questions that he gets to try and implement into the site. We will also elicit users about some of the things that they would like to see on the website and implement the more popular ideas. Another step we would take is showing the progress on the website as development goes on to guage the stakeholders opinions and to get feedback and changes that they would want to see.
## 6.2 Preliminary deployment concept
The solution will be validated by demonstrating it to the stakeholders and showing the functionalities that were included and how the site runs overall. Then the site will go live and advertised on business's work vehicles and on business cards.
## 6.3 Preliminary support concept
The website will be supported for as long as the company is in business or until they decide to get a new website, and will recieve updates when the owner requests that new information be added to the site.
## 6.4 Preliminary retirement concept
The website will be retired either when the company no longer has any need for it or if the company decides to get another new website made to replace this one, in which case the old one will redirect any viitors to the new site and after a while will stop service altogether.
# 7. Project Constraints
Due to the small size of the team, development will be relatively slow and will not have many resources in terms of funds to go above and beyond with the project.
